# Correlation-Power-Analysis-Attack
Implemented a correlation power analysis (CPA) attack and recovered a full round key used in an AES encryption process, with a set of power traces of the 128-bit AES core running on an FPGA board already acquired in the NUEESS lab (https://chest.coe.neu.edu/) of Northeastern University.
